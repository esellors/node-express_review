# Routing Review
## Base route: https://cprz6.sse.codesandbox.io/

### An interactive app made as a review for working with routing in Node.js using an Express server

Using postman, review what each route is in the src/index.js src file and what each route's handler function requires.

Try hitting each route to manipulate the messages stored in server/controllers/messageLogController.

For fun, certain messages will log in Codesandbox's console.

EXAMPLE: To get all messages, send a 'get' request to https://cprz6.sse.codesandbox.io/api/chat
